   This project deals with creating a working chatbot trained on Stanford question answering data set (squad 2.0). Chatbots have become integral part of our day-to-day life and in almost all industries. So, it is essential that AI Engineers know all the nuances of its creation, training and maintenance. Squad 2.0 data set contains large corpus of data collected on various topics from Music to Physics.

The squad 2.0 data set is downloaded from Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/stanford) as the base to train our models to be used in the chatbot. The data was in Json format with a field called “context” and a set of questions based on context.
